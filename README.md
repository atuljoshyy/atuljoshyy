I am Atul Joshy and I am the co-founder of doppl.club. I'm passionate about programming, especially web development, and in my free time (almost all the time! 🤭), I'm probably playing the drums or taking pictures of random things. I love to explore new opportunities and do things that no one has done before. I am currently studying B-Tech CSE (Cloud Computing) at VIT Bhopal.<br>
